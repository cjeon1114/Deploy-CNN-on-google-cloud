# Deploy-CNN-on-google-cloud
This project shows how to deploy a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on google cloud (App Engine). This is an instruction for how to use Keras and Flask to deploy a CNN model on GCP. 
1. Create a new python environment:

        pip install virtualenv
Once virtualenv is installed you should create and activate a new python environment:
        
        virtualenv <name_of_enviroment> (e.g. virtualenv web_app)
        source <directory_to_the_name_of_enviroment>/bin/activate (e.g. source web_app/bin/activate)
Then you should clone to this GitHub and download the files:
        
         git clone
